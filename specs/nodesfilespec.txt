Specification of a nodes file.

Items are white space separated.

NODESFILE ::=
  Filename of necklace input file
  Number of nodes
  as many NODEs

NODE ::=
  pubcrawl string
  PCT

PCT ::=
  Number of rows
  as many ROWs

ROW ::=
  E value        (row numbers are 1-based)
  F value
  L value
  half-edge-type number as in necklace input file

That is it.

Thus, one way to implement a search program is to have
two programs:

  crawlinit NECKLACEFILE CRAWLSTRING LAYER0NODESFILE

which computes the layer 0 containing nodes with PCTs with 2 rows,
and then

  crawl INPUTNODES DESCENDANTS FAILURES

Alternatively one could provide a complete crawler:

  crawler NECKLACEFILE CRAWLSTRING TIMEOUT

which produces layer after layer until one of the following happens:
  some FAILURES were found
  no more descendants were found (i.e. SUCCESS)
  TIMEOUT happens
