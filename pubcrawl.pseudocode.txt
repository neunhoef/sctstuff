Input:
  A pongo as Cayley-table
  Circle
  A list of necklaces, 
    each necklace has:
    
  A list of edges in the form of a half-edge-type list with a pairing
    each half-edge-type has:

  A pubcrawl as a string in the letters "E", "F" and "L" (for "F" inverse)

plus

  either "INIT" to create the initial layer
  or a list of partial coset tables (PCTs)

Output:
  A list of partial coset tables still to be looked at
  A list of partial coset tables which are failures
  A mu and epsilon-value

  If both lists are empty, the search was successful.

A PCT has:

  A Pubcrawl and a starting position in it.
  A list of rows (even length), where each row has:
    An ID               (row number)
    the E-image         (always filled in)
    the F-image         (can be -1 for empty)
    the F^-1-image      (can be -1 for empty)
    the half-edge-type  (always filled in, index in input list)

Axiom for the search:
  Entries that are not filled in will never be filled in with a number
  in the current list of rows but only with numbers of newly created
  rows.

"INIT"-case:

  produce all PCTs with two rows and empty "F" and "L" columns
  in which the depot values are at least -circle/3

"RUN"-case:

  for each PCT p do
    check every partial F-cycle for overrun and
          every full F-cycle for completeness
      --> fail p if anything found
    check every partial V-cycle to compute lower bound of valency
    check every full V-cycle for exact valency
      --> fail p if valency 1 or 2 found
    trace pubcrawl as far as possible, 3 possible outcomes:
      boozer dies: --> fail p
      boozer returns to start: --> report p as a failure
      boozer gets stuck without dieing:
        in this case we need to disjoin new cases:
          we always add exactly two new rows, which are E-images of each other
          the new edge makes the pubcrawl go one step further
          we try all possible edges for which the boozer does not die
          for the three unclear entries we try (independently) all
            possibilities of "empty" and all previous values, such that:
              ...
            --> report all emerging PCTs as PCTs to be worked on

  keep track of mu and epsilon
