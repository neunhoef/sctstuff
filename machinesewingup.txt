  B bridge words: subset of E
  E subset of elements of P, with a word for each
  els of A and E have a weight >0 ints

  cayley table for a pongo structure on E

  R relators
  
0) n1 b n2 b^-1
   run machine to largest extent, trying just one way
   replace edge ends by word that represents them
   take this as new possible relator

1) make list of all edges:
   n1 b n2 b^-1    (two notch types and a bridge word)
   use machine to "sew up" all edges on both sides, try all ways, but
       remove duplicates
   --> necklace rep

2) 2-dim analysis with necklace rep and vertex pongo

3) word problem solver:
