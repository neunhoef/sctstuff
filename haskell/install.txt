Installation instructions :

I installed GHC via the Haskell Platform :
	http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/
I'll play with the newer version here soonish because it supports -fllvm
for shared libraries, which the platform distribution won't support till May.
	http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_4_1#binaries
I found the platform version installed the library package manager cabal
quite cleanly though.

Install the graphviz package with the command :
	cabal install graphviz
I donno if this requires that you have the real graphviz installed, but
possibly. You can disable graphviz by commenting out the import PCTGraph
line and the tree and graph functions in navigator.hs.  Or you can ask me
to write a version that outputs to a file instead of X11.  I'll simply
change the runGraphvizCanvas command to a runGraphviz command.

Unpack the git bundle using :
	git clone pubcrawl.bundle -b master pubcrawl

Compile all the modules except navigator itself using the command :
	ghc -O2 navigator.hs
It'll complain about nagivator.hs not possessing any main, which doesn't
bother us.  If you skip this step it'll still run, but all modules will
load interpreted, making it extremely slow. 

Instead, we'll run the navigator.hs interpreted via the command :
	ghci navigator.hs

I wouldn't view navigator.hs as the real interface, it's just some silly
simple debug wrappers, which also loads all the real modules into the ghci's
namespace.
