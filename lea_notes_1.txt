We ran LEA on a series of examples of random one relator quotients of the
modular group, twenty different relators of each size 25-45.  We found huge
numbers of subflowers for 25-29, a few relators with few or no sunflowers
for 30-37, roughly half without sunflowers at 38, and progressively more
without sunflowers through 45.  We never reached 100% without any sunflowers.

We should rerun this data with many more than twenty per length over the
lengths 30-50.  It would be surprising if this threshold at 38 survived
in a larger data set, but nevertheless the density of sunflowers does not
appear to follow a naieve logistic curve.
